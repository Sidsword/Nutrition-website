                A personâ€™s build depends largely on genetic factors, which is why it is difficult for a naturally thin person to put on weight. The human body can change to a limited extent through weight training and increased food intake. Gaining or regaining weight can be just as difficult as losing weight. When done in a smart, healthful way, many of the same basic principles apply to both gaining and losing weight.
              </p>
              <p class="center">  
                It is important to consult with your doctor to make sure that your weight-gaining tactics are healthy and appropriate for you.

              <p class="center">
                Things that can contribute to making people gain weight include:
              </p>
<p class="center">
    Eating foods that are too high in fat and sugar<br>
    Eating too much of any food (too much energy for what your body needs)<br>
    Eating large serve sizes<br>
    Drinking too much soft drink, cordial, sports and energy drinks<br>
    Drinking too much alcohol<br>
    Not doing enough physical activity<br>
    Some medications.<br>

                <p class="center">
    Eating and drinking foods that are high in fat and sugar, eating large serves, drinking alcohol, some medications and not being very active all contribute to weight gain.<br>
    Eating fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, lean meat, chicken and fish can help you to maintain a healthy weight.<br>
    Many foods have hidden fat and sugar.<br>
    The more active you are, the easier it will be to lose weight and stay healthy.<br>
